synopsis:       Automatically converting ASTs into compositional data types
description:    Template Haskell for converting an AST for a language written using normal
                algebraic data types into ones written using multi-sorted compositional data types
                (`Data.Comp.Multi` from the `compdata` library) so that you can use generic and modular operators
                on it. You might need to add additional constructors that can e.g.: convert a (Term e Foo) into a
                (Term e [Foo]).
                .
                The sCource files have comments showing example output for a simple language. See the examples directory
                for an extended example of generating a compositional data type for the entire Java language, with labelled variants
                as well as variants where an entire project of source files can be treated as a single AST -- and you can use the same operations
                on all of them!
